# Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by Jazmynn-Jade Daos

According to Zinsser, American writing is cluttered. We inflate sentences to sound important and smart, but consequently make it harder for readers to understand the main points; longer does not always mean better. Clutter is the phrase that implies the same meaning as its shorter word and is used to hide mistakes and bad news. Clutter is the enemy. Clear writing requires clear thinking, which requires conscious effort. To recognize clutter and simplify writing, put brackets around unnecessary words or phrases and remove those that have no purpose. Writing is hard, but writing clear is harder.
